// The error you're encountering indicates that PowerShell's execution policy is preventing the script for `json-server` from running. By default, PowerShell restricts the execution of scripts for security reasons. You can resolve this issue by changing the execution policy.

// Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

// ### Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
// 1. Press `Win + X` or right-click on the Start menu.
// 2. Select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Windows Terminal (Admin)**.

// ### Step 2: Check the Current Execution Policy
// You can check the current execution policy by running:
// ```powershell
// Get-ExecutionPolicy
// ```
// This will display the current policy (e.g., `Restricted`, `RemoteSigned`, `Unrestricted`, etc.).

// ### Step 3: Change the Execution Policy
// To change the execution policy, you can run one of the following commands:

// - To allow scripts to run only if they are signed:
//     ```powershell
//     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
//     ```

// - To allow all scripts to run (less secure):
//     ```powershell
//     Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
//     ```

// **Note:** If prompted to confirm the change, type `Y` and press Enter.

// ### Step 4: Run Your Command Again
// After changing the execution policy, try running your `json-server` command again:
// ```powershell
// json-server --watch db.json
// ```

// ### Step 5: Revert to Default (Optional)
// If you want to revert to the default execution policy after running your script, you can set it back to `Restricted`:
// ```powershell
// Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
// ```

// ### Important Security Note
// Be cautious when changing the execution policy, especially to `Unrestricted`, as it may expose your system to malicious scripts. If you only need to run specific scripts, using `RemoteSigned` is generally a safer choice.

// ### Additional Help
// If you want more information about execution policies, you can refer to the official Microsoft documentation:
